package Sayer2::Preconditions;

# this is a program to generate preconditions to determine what tests
# to run on a particular piece of data

# do we induct formula's to test on based on results?

# how does it depend on the task context?  Perhaps we can keep other
# data points in mind when running these programs.

# so for instance, if it looks like a sentence, try detecting the
# language, etc.

# are these manually generated rules or can they be automatically
# inferred.

# perhaps we can issue queries?  maybe we do a game search for
# interesting results.  Perhaps question networks is the way to go.
# then that's too much like programming, we need the system to do some
# of the exploration.  it should try executing things with a time
# limit..., offset by a measure of how important the result is
# expected to be?  We need certain features to cause recognition of
# possible results.  For instance, it should learn that for instance a
# capital word may precipitate a sentence...  How does it learn that?
# perhaps we need to set up a feature set and learn over it, we would
# need snow for it.
